Fake MPEG DASH Live profile end point
=====================================

A Google App Engine project that provides an end point for multiple MPEG DASH
manifests. These manifests are dynamically generated from templates of various
vendor's packaging output.

The principal use for this service is to test live DASH streams using
non-live, rights cleared material. In this case, it uses Big Buck Bunny
as the test file.
